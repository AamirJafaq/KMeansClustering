# KMeansClustering
In this document, we select a dataset that is already organized into clusters. Using the K-means clustering algorithm, we will demonstrate that it produces the same clustering results. \
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group unlabeled data into clusters. It organizes data points into groups based on their similarities. Unlike supervised learning, K-means does not use labeled data, meaning the data points don’t have predefined categories. Instead, it identifies patterns and forms clusters without prior information. There are different types of clustering methods, such as exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic. K-means is an exclusive (or "hard") clustering method, meaning each data point can belong to only one cluster. This makes it useful for tasks like market segmentation, document grouping, image segmentation, and image compression. It is popular because it’s simple, effective, and fast.
