Among the different types of clustering algorithms such as exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic, K-means is an example of an exclusive (or “hard”) clustering method. In this approach, each data point is assigned to exactly one cluster, meaning it cannot belong to multiple groups at the same time."
